### Tutorial Overview
#### 1. Introduction
Get started with Leaflet and learn the basics of interactive maps. This section introduces you to the Leaflet library and sets up the foundation for creating your first map.

#### 2. Basic Map
Create a simple Leaflet map and customize its appearance. Learn how to initialize a map, add tile layers, and set the view to your desired location.

#### 3. Markers and Popups
Add markers and popups to your Leaflet map for interactive information. Understand how to bind popups to markers and customize their appearance.

#### 4. Polygons and Circles
Draw polygons and circles on your Leaflet map to highlight areas. Learn how to create these shapes and style them to match your map's theme.

#### 5. Working with GeoJSON
Utilize GeoJSON data to create and display geographical features on your map. This section covers loading GeoJSON data and customizing its display with Leaflet.

#### 6. User Interactions
Implement user interactions such as drawing, measuring, and geocoding on your map. Enhance your map with tools that allow users to interact with it more effectively.

#### 7. Choropleth Map
Create a choropleth map with colored regions based on data values. Learn how to visualize data distribution across geographical regions using color gradients.
